            <!--here is the section for the main content of each page-->
            In contrast to past presidential assassinations, James A. Garfield's murder receives the least attention. On July 2, 1881, Garfield had only been in office for four months when Charles Guiteau fatally shot him in broad daylight.</p>
            <p>
                Garfield was departing from the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington, D.C., for his summer vacation with his sons in Massachusetts. The Secret Service and other security measures were not as advanced for early presidents, making them easy
                targets when out in public. The president's travel plans were known to the public, so Guiteau just waited for Garfield to arrive in the station lobby before bursting out of the shadows and shooting him in the head. Garfield was struck
                in the arm and the back by one of Guiteau's two rounds. But neither shot proved lethal. No essential organs were harmed by the bullets. </p>
            <p>
                Many people gathered around Garfield to treat his wounds in an effort to aid the hurt president. Several men poked and prodded at Garfield's open wounds with unclean hands, trying to pry the bullet from his body. When compared to today, precautions about
                illnesses and germs were not fully recognized. Many doctors tried unsuccessfully for days after the shooting to find and remove the bullets from Garfield's body.</p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, Garfield contracted an infection and got very sick as a result of all the exposure to germs. He continued to be bedridden as his heart weakened and he started to lose weight. President Garfield passed away on September 19, 1881, 79 days
                after the shooting, from a ruptured splenic artery aneurysm brought on by sepsis and pneumonia. If he had received competent care, it is thought that Garfield would have likely survived his injuries. Garfield‚Äôs final resting place was
                built as a memorial of his life, located in Lake View Cemetery in his hometown Cleveland, Ohio.
