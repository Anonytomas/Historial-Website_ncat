            On November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, a car struck and killed John F. Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States. Out of the 4 presidential assassinations, this one was the most gruesome and well-known of them. Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S.
            Marine who had embraced Marxism and briefly defected to the Soviet Union, is the man who is suspected of killing him. Oswald was shot and killed by Jack Ruby, a devastated Dallas nightclub owner, as he was being transported after being brought
            into jail, therefore he was never put on trial for murder. Despite the Warren Commission's findings to the contrary, which was set up by Kennedy's successor, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, to investigate the assassination, many Americans
            believed the popular young president's death was the product of a conspiracy rather than a single person. The occurrence continued to be the focus of much controversy.</p>
            <p>
                On November 21, 1963, President Kennedy traveled to Texas for a two-day, five-city fund-raising excursion with his wife, Jacqueline Kennedy, and Vice President Johnson. The trip was probably also designed to try and unite a divided Democratic Party in
                a state that was crucial to Kennedy's hopes of winning reelection in 1964. The president was warmly welcomed at his first two stops, San Antonio and Houston, as well as at Fort Worth, where the presidential party spent the night of November
                21. This is despite the fact that Adlai Stevenson, the U.S. ambassador to the UN and a liberal icon, had been confronted by flustered protesters a month earlier during a visit to Dallas—a city with a right-leaning press and the epicenter
                of much anti-Kennedy feeling.</p>
            <p>
                Kennedy and his group took a quick flight to Dallas Love Field airport the following morning after giving a speech in a parking lot in front of the hotel where he had stayed and then speaking once more at a Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce breakfast. Before
                boarding the backseat of a modified open convertible at the airport to accompany Democratic Texas Governor John Connally and his wife (who sat in jump seats in front of the Kennedys) to the president's next stop, the Trade Mart, where
                Kennedy was scheduled to give another speech, the president and first lady shook hands with members of a hospitable crowd. On the roughly 10-mile (16-km) road to the Trade Mart, there were 200,000 people expected to be lined up.</p>
            <p>
                The president's convertible passed the tall Texas School Book Depository building as the procession swung southwest on Elm Street and entered Dealey Plaza on the outskirts of downtown Dallas. Shots were fired a short while later, about 12:30 PM. According
                to the Warren Report, a bullet likely entered the president's neck at the base and went through his throat before passing through Governor Connally's shoulder and wrist and striking him in the thigh. Kennedy was wounded by a second bullet
                to the back of the head. The motorcade swiftly arrived at the neighboring Parkland Memorial Hospital, but the doctors' attempts proved fruitless. Kennedy was pronounced dead in a formal manner around 1:00 PM. Connally made it through his
                injuries. Works Cited</p>
