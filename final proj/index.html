            <p>
                Welcome to Historic Places, a website built to cover important historical events from the past that define our world today. Our goal is to gather, curate, and provide quality and scholarly sourced information and publish it in a condensed format. Our
                website is built to be scalable and accessible to both readers and editors so we can provide a platform for those who are interested in history.
            </p>
            <p>
                History is a powerful tool that we can use to learn from our mistakes, imagine new ideas, and create a better world for everyone. That’s why at Historic Places we promote an objective historical perspective that is not directly influenced by any organization—political
                or religious. History is happening every day, to understand the events, struggles, and triumphs of today, it is increasingly important to study history.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to articles regarding historic topics, we also include links to relevant videos and social media posts that allow our visitors to interact with others who are interested in a particular historical topic. Because we understand that people learn
                and interact with historical content in different ways, we have incorporated elements such as tables into our website for a more analytical view of the data that historical events produce.
            </p>
            <p>
                <div class="tooltip">Our first historical events cover three of the four presidential assassinations in the United States.
                    <span class="tooltiptext">Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, John F. Kennedy</span>
                </div>&nbsp;However, we have included a short table that shows who was shot, the shooter, the date of the shooting, and the date of the president's death. An interesting note to add is that all four assassinations were carried out with a gun.
            </p>
