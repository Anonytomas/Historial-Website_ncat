            <h1>Normandy</h1>
            <p>World War II was a traumatic event of human history that started with the invasion of Poland by Germany. The Allies, (Britain, France, Russia, China, and the United States) fought the Axis (Germany, Italy, and Japan. The Holocaust, one of the worst events in all of history, was the Hitler‚Äôs vision of ridding Germany of the Jewish people or anyone that Hitler deemed unsatisfactory for his view of an ‚ÄúAryan Race‚Äù.
                 He sent them to concentration camps where people were often worked to death and discarded. The conditions of concentration camps were horrific.
            </p>
            <p>D-Day was one of several major battles during the span of World War II. The operation the Allies conducted was codenamed ‚ÄúOVERLORD‚Äù‚Äîa joint naval assault on the beaches of Normandy, France.
