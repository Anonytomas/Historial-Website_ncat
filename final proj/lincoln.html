            <p>Actor John Wilkes Booth killed President Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865, shortly after entering the presidential box at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. Booth jumped onto the stage and fled out the back door as Lincoln sagged forward
                in his chair. A medical professional in the crowd hastened to inspect the president who is paralyzed. After being brought across the street to Petersen's Boarding House, Lincoln passed away there the following morning.</p>
            <p>
                Lincoln was the first president in American history to be killed. Booth's motivation for doing it is unknown. He believed it would benefit the South, which had recently given up to Federal forces. Lincoln's aspirations for a rather generous peace were
                effectively thwarted, having the exact opposite effect. It was not Booth acting alone. With a reward for information leading to the arrest of Booth and his cronies, this "wanted" poster circulated widely. Booth was shot while attempting
                to flee from Union soldiers after the conspirators had all been apprehended.</p>
            <p>
                President Lincoln's passing was lamented by the entire nation. People flocked to train stops all along the route to offer their respects as the nine-car funeral train brought President Lincoln home to be buried in Springfield, Illinois.
