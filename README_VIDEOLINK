**What is this?**

This is a website designed to host historical content. This was the final project for a web design course focusing on HTML and CSS web design.

**How I worked on this project**

* I worked with two colleagues to organize and implement this website.
* Most of my time was spent editing HTML and CSS to add features and improve the design of web pages.
* I implemented many of the cited descriptions and images used for content.

**Why we built the project this way**

* During the semester, we built up the tools and experience required for the final from course assignments.
* We repurposed previous assignments to provide reference and structure to our final project.
* I created and updated a guideline based on the grading rubric for this assignment. We followed it closely to ensure success.

**If I had more time, I would change this**

* For most of this project, we used FileZilla as an FTP--In hindsight, it could have been easier for us to use GitHub Desktop.
* I would improve the viewing compatibility of the website to perform better in Google Chrome. We used Edge/Safari for our testing.
* Modern web-building toolkits could be implemented to upgrade the graphics and overall attractiveness of the web pages.
